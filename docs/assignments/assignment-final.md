# IDM221 Final Project

This page describes an assignment for this course. Due dates and submissions are handled through [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/).

## Final Project

Your final project represents the culmination of past ten weeks. A multipage website programmed with HTML and CSS displaying your online portfolio (or a different, agreed upon topic). This project will be graded based on the following criteria:

1. Code Quality
    - Is all of your code valid?
    - Did you follow best practices regarding file names, characters, coding styles?
    - Is your code legible and easy to navigate?
    - Does your code use comments?
1. Functionality
    - Everything needs to work (e.g. links, videos, audio, images, rollovers etc.). If it's part of your site it must be working properly.
1. Design
    - Is your site visually pleasing?
    - Is your content legible with proper contrast, color scheme, typography etc.?
    - Would you feel comfortable using this project in a job interview as an example of your skills?

## Submitting the Assignment

Submit the following items in [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/) under **Final Project**:

1. A link to your self hosted website home page. From this page, I should be able to get to every other page within the site.
1. A link to your GitHub repository containing the code for your final project. Remember: a well maintained repository does not include binary files, but these files are essential to your project. Host the files on your server and use documentation within your project to include references and links for downloads of critical binary files.
   - Your repository **must** be named using the following naming convention: _idm221-xxx_ where _xxx_ is your Drexel ID shorthand. For example, for me this would be _idm221-ps42_. [Help renaming your GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/renaming-a-repository) (complete the steps outlined in the numbered list, you do not have to worry about the command line instructrions)

**Late submissions receive zero points.**
